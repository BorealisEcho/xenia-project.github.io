## Settings

### Game-Specific Settings

Many Xbox 360 games require special settings to be emulated on xenia-canary accurately. If you are facing issues running a game, search [A1eNaz's Xenia-Game-Settings wiki](https://github.com/A1eNaz/Xenia-Game-Settings/wiki), find the game and try the recommended settings by editing the *xenia-canary.config.toml* accordingly.

### Game Patches

Additionally to the settings above, xenia-canary is capable of applying user-made patches to the emulated games.
These patches provide can provide several fixes and improvements to games such as unlocked FPS, rendering fixes and others.
Check the [game-patches repository](https://github.com/xenia-canary/game-patches) to learn more and download the available patches.
